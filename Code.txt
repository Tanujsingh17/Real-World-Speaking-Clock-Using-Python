Using Audacity software I have created the recordings, place the recordings the python code in the same folder.


# importing required module
import datetime as dt
import time

## for getting the current time
time_now=dt.datetime.now().time()
print("The time now is-",time_now)

# getting hour and minutes values as integers and storing them in suitable variables
print("Hour:",time_now.hour)

print("Minute:",time_now.minute)
print("Seconds:",time_now.second)  ## just for fun

# determine which files to play
# creating variables to store the hour and minute audio file
hour_filename=f"up-{time_now.hour}.mp3"
print("Hour file name:",hour_filename)  ## not needed
minute_filename=f"down-{time_now.minute}.mp3"
print("Minute file name:",minute_filename)  ## not needed

# for the hours the audio files with the suffix "up" should be used
# for the minutes the audio files with the suffix "down" should be used
# play audio files accordingly
def music_time(filename):
    from pygame import mixer     # for playing the audiofiles
    mixer.init()                 # starting the mixer
    mixer.music.load(filename)   # loading the mixer
    mixer.music.set_volume(0.7)  # setting the volume
    mixer.music.play()           # start playing the song
music_start=music_time("The_time_now_is.mp3")
time.sleep(3) # provides time gap in seconds
music_up_hour=music_time(hour_filename)
time.sleep(1.2)
music_down_minute=music_time(minute_filename)
time.sleep(1)
